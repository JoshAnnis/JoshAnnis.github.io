        <h1>These are my hobbies</h1>
        	 <div class="col-md-4">
           	  <P>Basketball has always been my go to sport when I was younger, I would always go and play basketball when ever I could. Growing up I wanted to be a basketball player so I could have lots of money to be able to help my family out and be able to pay for their bills and house. I always had planned to buy everyone a car. </P>

         	 <div class="col-sm-6  col-md-4">
           	<p> I never really got into coding until my high school years. It wasnt until then that I had a chance to be part of a cyber security team, and ever since then i've wannted to be a part of the digatil world as it conutines to grow. I think why coding is so imporant to me is because it challenges me to learn new things.I love the fact that at some point in time i could make something that is one day used by everyone and to here there is nothing better than that.</p>	
           	</div>
          <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4">
			<P> I, like most  of the boys my age  love to spend hours in front of a tv and play video games. If i had to tell you which one is my favorite i dont think i could because there are just so many that i love to play. I love everything about Video Games, like the far off places, the magic that some have, and mostly being the hero that everyone needs. I love being able to help people so to be the hero of the story is amazing.</p>
          <div>
          <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4">
            <p> On of my newer hobbies is Brazilian jiu jitsu, I have only done it for about a month or so but in that short time I have learned a lot of new things, and met some new people.</p>
