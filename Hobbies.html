                  <P>Basketball has always been my go to sport, especially when I was younger. I would always go play basketball any time I could. Growing up I wanted to be a basketball player so I could have lots of money because I wanted to be able to help my family out by being able to pay for their bills and house. I even planned to buy everyone a car. </P>

                   <p> I didn't get interested in coding until I was in high school. I had the chance to be a part of my school's cyber security team during my Junior and Senior years. Ever since then, I've wanted to be a part of the digital world. It is exciting to see it as it continues to grow. The reason that coding is so important to me is because it challenges me to learn new things. I love the fact that at some point in time I could make something that is one day used by everyone. I feel that there is nothing better than that.</p>

               <p> I, like most  of the boys my age, love to spend hours in front of a tv and play video games. If I were asked which one is my favorite I dont think would be able to answer that question because there are just so many games I love to play. I love everything about Video Games, for instance, you are submerged in far off places, the magic that some games have, and mostly being the hero that everyone needs. I love being able to help people so to be the hero of the story is amazing. One of my newer hobbies is Brazilian Jiu jJitsu. I have only been doing it for a couple of months, but in that short time I have learned a lot of new things and met some great new people.</p>
