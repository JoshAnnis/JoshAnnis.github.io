            <p>Hello my name is Josh and I want you to get to know me.
            I am from Washington and have justed moved to Wisconsin. I lived most of my life in washington I guess my whole life up till now. But since I moved here a year ago I have done things that I would never do, like taking Braziln Jiu jitsu and coming to a 12 week coding bootcamp.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="class-sm-6 col-md-4">
        <p> Growing up I never thought that I would be anybody speical because I never had the drive to make my dreams come true, I only wished that things would happen the way i wanted to. But I knew that my passion was to make something great that my friends and family would be lke I know the maker of this</p>      
          </div>
          <div class="class-sm-6 col-md-4">
        <p>But I put my passion on hold for a while because I didnt think I could achieve my dreams; then one day my grandma was like "josh what do you want to do with your life whats your plan?" and I thought it over and I said "you know im not to sure about that yet but I did see this School where they teach you to code in 12 weeks" and my grandma said to me "ok and what is it going to take for you to go to that?"</p>
